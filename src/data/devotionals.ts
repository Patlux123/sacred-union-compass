    title: "Christ at the Center",
    scripture: "Matthew 6:33",
    verse: "But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.",
    teaching: "When Jesus is at the center of your marriage, everything else aligns better — communication, intimacy, finances, and purpose. Couples who prioritize God together experience a deeper unity. Busyness, stress, and worldly distractions try to steal that focus, but coming back to Christ daily recalibrates your relationship.",
    reflection: "How can we seek God first in our marriage today?",
    prayer: "Jesus, we invite You into the center of our marriage. Help us prioritize Your presence over all else. Let Your will shape our relationship. Amen."

    scripture: "Romans 12:18",
    verse: "If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.",
    teaching: "Pride often whispers, 'I'm right.' But peace says, 'Let's understand each other.' In marriage, winning an argument is less important than winning each other's hearts. Humility is the gateway to peace.",
    reflection: "Is there anywhere I've let pride create distance between us?",
    prayer: "Lord, teach us humility. Help us choose peace over pride and unity over being right. Amen."

    verse: "Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.",
    teaching: "Forgiveness isn't just for major offenses — it's a daily choice. Small irritations, unmet expectations, or careless words can quietly build walls. But forgiveness tears down those walls, creating space for grace, growth, and deeper love.",
    reflection: "What small (or big) offense do I need to let go of today?",
    prayer: "God, thank You for forgiving us. Help us extend that same forgiveness freely, so nothing divides our hearts. Amen."

    scripture: "Proverbs 15:1",
    verse: "A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.",

    reflection: "How can I use my words today to uplift rather than wound?",
    prayer: "Lord, guard our tongues. Let our words be filled with kindness, understanding, and grace. Amen."

    prayer: "God, help us grow together in faith. Sharpen one another lovingly as we walk with You. Amen."

    verse: "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.",

    reflection: "Where do we need to let go of control and trust God more?",
    prayer: "Father, we release our fears to You. Help us lean on Your wisdom rather than our limited understanding. Amen."

    scripture: "Proverbs 4:23",
    verse: "Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.",

    reflection: "What area of our marriage needs more protection or intentionality?",
    prayer: "God, help us guard our hearts and our marriage. Keep us alert to anything that could harm our bond. Amen."

    reflection: "What is one thing about my spouse I'm thankful for today?",
    prayer: "Father, help us cultivate grateful hearts. Let thanksgiving flow easily between us, reminding us of Your goodness and each other's value. Amen."
